## Simple NLP Knowledge Graph with spaCy and NetworkX
This repository demonstrates how to build and visualize a simple knowledge graph from text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and graph theory. The project uses spaCy for entity and relationship extraction and networkx for creating and visualizing the knowledge graph.

### Features
- Entity Extraction: Identifies key entities from the text using spaCy.
- Relationship Extraction: Extracts relationships between entities based on grammatical dependencies.
- Graph Construction: Creates a directed graph using networkx, where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships.
- Visualization: Displays the knowledge graph with nodes and edges labeled for easy interpretation.
